I am a student at Ponaganset High School in the Computer Science & Information Technology, and Biomedical Science pathways. I have been fascinated with computer science since I discovered programming in sixth grade.

My current long-term project happens to be an educational program for demonstrating the fundamentals of computing. This project draws inspiration from a past project, and replicates aspects of common instruction sets. In my free time, I develop miscellaneous tools which are published on my Github.
