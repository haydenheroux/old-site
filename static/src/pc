# Motivation

Following three years of using a pre-built computer, my personal computer was built to outpace my previous desktop in intensive workloads and to provide a substantial quality of life improvement by moving to a compact mini-ITX case. Increasing levels of bloat in the software required by my high school's computer science pathway, as well as a growing need to run increasingly complex programs, crushed the measly eight gigabytes of RAM available, which led to a sluggish user experience. Although the memory could be upgraded to an excessive amount (e.g. 32 gigabytes), my computer would eventually be limited by other factors, so I decided it was time for a complete refresh to occur. 

# Expectations and Parts Selection

While the older pre-built served me well when it was primarily used as a Minecraft and Firefox box, my advancement through the computer science pathway at my high school and the acquisition of new interests led to the expectations of my computer's operation increasing. At the time of building this computer, I needed a computer which could: 

- Run a development environment and compile software
- Create music using a DAW
- Rip media and edit HD video
- Play legacy and indie games

Many of these tasks benefit from hyper-threading and multiple cores; the tools used for software compilation, for example, benefit from being run across parallel processing units. Unfortunately, single core performance is still required, whether it be for poorly optimized games such as Minecraft, or for use in decompression/trans-coding processes, which will be in use rather often. Consequently, single core performance is needed as well as multi-core performance, which is a difficult combination to find at a reasonable price. Despite the heavy overclocking capability of a 10900K, the intense thermal load could negate most performance benefits, and other Intel offerings prior to 12th generation chips appeared to be lackluster. A similar story occurred with AMD's 5900X and 3950X; both are solid offerings which would be absolutely worthwhile if value was of no object or if my workload was expected to require 100% of the resources, but the potential performance was simply not worth the price. As competing parts were eliminated, AMD's 5800X processor remained a good option for me, with eight cores and sixteen threads, while also maintaining some headroom for future tweaks.
With a CPU decided upon, focus soon shifted to selecting a motherboard which could meet a variety of specifications, many of which to ensure that future upgrades will be unnecessary for as long as possible. The first of these features would be 2.5 gigabit internet, which is an explicit requirement as I add more network-attached storage devices to my home rack, in addition to being generally useful as neighborhoods around mine are beginning to install increasing amounts of high-speed Internet infrastructure. An additional requirement for a motherboard which will operate into the future would be USB-C connectivity options, which will slowly become the norm as older USB standards are phased out. A final requirement for a motherboard, although essentially ubiquitous on boards past 2018, would be the inclusion of at least one, preferably multiple, M.2 slots, as running SATA cables is an annoyance, and there is no way to make full use of more than two SATA drives in a Mini-ITX build.
A board which met these requirements, while also providing some sense of quality over other boards, was the Asus ROG Strix B550-I. Although the Asus laptops provided by my summer job were of appalling build quality, Asus's gaming products appeared to offer an improvement over parts from Gigabyte and ASRock, which produced the other motherboards which met the upgradability expectations. In tandem with this Mini-ITX motherboard I chose other small form factor components, such as the SF 600W Platinum power supply from Corsair and the 120mm variant of the Arctic Liquid Freezer II, to supply my choice of CPU with plenty of potential without resorting to non-standard parts. Cooling of the 120mm radiator was to be handled by a Noctua NF-A12x25 intake fan, and a NF-A9x14 chassis fan would be used to exhaust any heat from the intake. All of these components would be built within a Silverstone SG13 case, which was relatively small and able to contain all of the components listed, albeit with cable management being a small challenge once the motherboard had all of its expansion slots filled.
